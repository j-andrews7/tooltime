# tooltime

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This a toy example R package for a seminar.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tooltime like so:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("j-andrews7/tooltime)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tooltime)

# Almost any type of gene identifier will work. Only the top hit for each query will be returned.
genes <- c(1017, "ENSG00000148795", "CDK2", "goobledegook")

summaries <- get_summaries(genes)

summaries
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks.

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. 
`devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to 
re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
